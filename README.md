**About **

Linux Foundation ranked `OpenStackÂ®` as the most popular open source project. It's market is projected to grow at 30+ percent in the upcoming several years. Openstack is gaining  more and more attraction in private cloud market and also serves as the foundation for public clouds. Organizations throughout the world have aggressive OpenStack adoption plans, but they list IT skills as their #1 challenge to getting started.

This course has been designed for IT professionals seeking to develop a solid understanding of OpenStack and it's core services. It will help any IT professional or manager who want to find out if OpenStack is the right solution to meet the needs of their organization. In addition to hands on lessons at the end of each section, the course also includes a separate section which includes the exact steps for deploying latest OpenStack release; Train (Released Oct, 2019). Participants will be able to start operating and using OpenStack to develop confidence for moving forward with next steps.

The course begins with an overview of cloud computing and OpenStack. After the overview there is a dedicated section to OpenStack installation which is followed by separate sections for each of the core openstack services and the web dashboard. In  each section we will go into the details of the service and it's architecture. For the most important services like Nova and Neutron we'll do a deeper dive and cover them in a much more detailed way.
